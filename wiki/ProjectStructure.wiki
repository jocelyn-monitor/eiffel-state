= Project Structure =

The projects consists of the following relatively independent parts:
  * *Library*: a set of classes that represent the concepts of Automata-based programming as directly as possible
  * *Visual Editor*: an EiffelStudio Tool that provides for visual construction, editing and debugging of automated classes logic. The editor can be further decomposed into the following components:
    * *GUI*: Graphical interface for editing STD
    * *Code generator*: Translating STD into Eiffel and back
    * *Visual debuger*: Translating Eiffel compiler/debugger output into STD
